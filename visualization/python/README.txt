Notes on Plotting done with slice_plot.py and slice_compare.py
(plotters of SAM and CAM averaged datafiles)

1- For occupation stats, black represents a collision cell that is empty in all the samples involved in the average (i.e., if
enough samples are involved, this is a cell that is exterior to teh boundary)

2- For averages, cells that are empty (see point 1) are painted white (white is not in the color scheme used by the color map)
